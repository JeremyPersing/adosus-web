A super simple fitness app for tracking your workouts, working out to a timer, and using different calculators to guage fitness levels.
This is a side project that I'm going to use to track my workouts and I may or may not work on when I get bored/want something new to work on.

Features:

- user login
- Ability to create workouts. Workout data should persist over multiple days, months, and years.
- Timer for tababta workouts, or timer based workouts.
- Get caloric intake suggestions calculator.
- One rep max calculator

Things I might implement:

- Be able to save different timer based workouts.
- Ability to track foods eaten throughout the day. This should persist over multiple days, months, and years. (I would probably be creating the api if I go this route, and that would probably be a product that I would sell).
- Want to see trend line data for workouts and calorie consumption.
